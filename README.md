# HomeGrub
 "HomeGrub" -a platform to take Indian food across geographies through innovative shipping methods.
 
 Most people love food from their home country/city and that taste is so unique that it very difficult to be replicated! 
 To get a courier of food items from home Country/City, the cost of shipping is atleast 2-3times the cost of food itself
 
 HomGrub solves this problem in two ways:
1. Gets better courier price by ordering in volumes and by using pre-negotitated discounted courier charges.
2. Uses crowdsourcing to get food items on flights.

It is a highly scalable idea, however has challenges like approved food items, Food quality from vendors etc
I worked with various courier vendors and negotiated a better per lb price. 
Validated the idea on a small scale by onboarding two operations volunteers for field work and 
acquired first 6 customers.

I saw that each customer who used HomeGrub using #1 above could save upto 25-33% cost of ordering individually. 
It proves that HomeGrub has value for customers. But I made just 5% in profits, so the margins are very less in #1.

I want to create technology products for both #1(optional) and #2.
#1 is an e-commerce page with streamlined payment mechanisms. 
I can workaround this using Facebook page and paypal payment in the short run.

#2 is a social networking platform where people share:
  a. their travel details and 
  b. how much weight of food/courier can they carry along. 
Then HomeGrub platform brings together:
1.parents/family/friends who can handover courier to the person travelling
2.person travelling , who is willing to carry food courier for a price
3.Recipient of food courier

In addition to technical Challenges, below operational challenges need to be adressed: 
  a. privacy of travel details when people are searching for match, 
  b. Customs and security clearance, 
  c. packaging
  
  ...To be continued, Work in Progress!!!
